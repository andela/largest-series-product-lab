#Largest Series product

You are to write a class that calculates and returns the product of the largest numbers in a series.

This will also apply to a collection of numbers in a list.

For example, for the input `'0123456789'`, the largest product for a
series of 3 digits is 504 (7 * 8 * 9), and the largest product for a
series of 5 digits is 15120 (5 * 6 * 7 * 8 * 9).

For the input `'73167176531330624919225119674426574742355349194934'`,
the largest product for a series of 6 digits is 23520.

##How to Run this Lab

+ Clone the repository
+ Open **index.html** in your browser to see the currently failing test specs you are to pass
+ Open the repository in your favorite text editor to explore the different files
+ Open **js\largest-series-product.js** and write the function(s) or lines of code to pass the tests
+ You could refresh **index.html** in your browser intermittently to see the status of test specs.


##Notes
+ Prior understanding of javascript classes and/or prototypes will be required to complete this lab.

+ Remember that passing code is just the first step. The goal is to work towards a solution that is as readable and expressive as you can make
it.

+ Please make your solution as general as possible. Good code doesn't just pass the test suite, it works with any input that fits the specification.

Have fun!
